        <p>
          Event will be held on 05/22/2019 during patrol at the police department.<br>
          Check #news to know when doors open. Park in the front of the PD, security guards will be there to let you into the PD cafeteria.<br>
          Each campaigner will have a time to speak and get their voices heard! This is a great event to help you decided who you want to vote for!<br>
          Food will be served halfway through the event. It is expected to last about 20-30 minutes.

        <h1>Memorial Day Parade</h1>
        <p>
          Thank you to everyone who came out! It was a nice little event to
          honor our veterans. Expect a recap video coming soon. The event
          started with a introduction from @mskellyplayz and speeches from
          @DummyBarz, @RudimentarySublime, @Lodan898, and @bluebatman825. The
          parade started, the route can be found below. Afterwards we took a
          screenshot. Overall it was a fun time! UDFR Events will learn from
          this event to bring even better events to the community!

          <p>
            Any vehicles are fine. Just try to avoid supercars and stay within
            your RP tier. Typically, the trucker Peterbilt Flatnose Cab can be
            paired with the "Flatbed" trailer to make a portable/mobile stage!
